•Potentiometer provides user input in the form of variable resistance
We feed the voltage provided by variable resistor (voltage which
represents position control) into ADC channels of Arduino We are
going to use four ADC channels of UNO from A 1 to A 4 for this

•After the ADC initialization, we will have digital value of
potentiometers representing the position needed by user We will
take this value and match it with servo position

•Arduino has six ADC channels We have used four for our Robotic
Arm The UNO ADC is of 10 bit resolution so the integer values ranging
from 0 1023 2 10 1024 values)

•This means that it will map input voltages between 0 and 5 volts into
integer values between 0 and 1023 So for every 5 1024 4 9 mV) per
unit We later changed mapping values to 0 511 to solve the buzz
problems during motor movements

•Arduino Uno has a feature which enables us to control the servo
position by just giving the degree value Say if we want the servo to
be at 30 we can directly represent the value in the program The
SERVO header Servo h file takes care of all the duty ratio
calculations internally

•There are four pots provided to the user And by rotating these four
pots, we provide variable voltage at the ADC channels of UNO So
the digital values of Arduino are under control of user

•These digital values are mapped to adjust the servo motor position,
hence the servo position is in control of user and by rotating these
Pots user can move the joints of Robotic arm and can pick or grab
any object
